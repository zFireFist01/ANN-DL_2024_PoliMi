# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Challenges

Repository for the two projects developed during the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL)** course at Politecnico di Milano.  
Each challenge was worth **5.5 points**: I scored the maximum in both (5.5/5.5), with a **3rd place in Challenge 2**.

The repo includes:
- 📄 Detailed reports in PDF
- 🧑‍💻 Jupyter notebooks with implemented models
- ⚙️ Preprocessing and training scripts

Each folder contains its own README with description and instructions.
