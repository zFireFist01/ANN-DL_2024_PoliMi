# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Homeworks

This repository contains the two projects developed during the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL)** course at Politecnico di Milano.  
Each homework was worth **5.5 points**: I achieved the maximum in both (5.5/5.5), with a **3rd place in the leaderboard for the second homework**.

## Repository Structure
- `First Homework/`  
  - `Final Delivery/` â†’ final report (`AN2DL_report.pdf`), final notebook, and trained model  
  - `notebooks/` â†’ experimental notebooks and alternative models
- `Second Homework/`  
  - `Final Delivery/` â†’ final report (`AN2DL_report.pdf`), final notebook
  - `notebooks/` â†’ experimental notebooks

ðŸ“„ Each homework folder contains its own README with description, approach, and results.
